# Tab Saver

## About

### Version Info

Version: v0.0.1 pre-alpha

### Summary

At it's core the aptly named "Tab Saver" is just that. A tab saver. During the duration of a windows life it tracks
the state of your tabs ~~and sells it to google~~. Then, upon the merciless execution of said window
that tab data gets saved and can be restored at a later date. 

## Next Steps

1. Testing. Lots of testing. \*closes book\* Like that's ever gonna happen.
2. Add more features
3. Rinse and repeat

### Feature Ideas

I have a nasty tendency to write these and then never act on them. So...don't get your hopes up. 

- Snapshotting current state
- Living window management
- Keyboard shortcuts <- BIG yes please
- Theming
- Sync vs local storage
- Incremental Loading(? idk what to call it) 

I would take feature requests, but I'm the only user lol (BUT if you want to request features, PLEASE DO!).
