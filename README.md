# Tab Saver

## About

At it's core the aptly named "Tab Saver" is just that. A tab saver. During the duration of a windows life it tracks
the state of your tabs ~~and sells it to google~~. Then, upon the merciless execution of said window
that tab data gets saved and can be restored at a later date. 

### The name...

...is not so good. I'm aware. Tab Saver is just a working name. I don't have viable ideas atm, but when I do rest assured
this will be updated. 

## Next Steps

I have a nasty tendency to write these and then never act on them. So...don't get your hopes up. 

### Fixes

- Finish loading message
- Testing. Lots of testing. \*closes book\* Like that's ever gonna happen.

### Feature Ideas

- Snapshotting current state
- Living window management
- Keyboard shortcuts <- BIG yes please
- Theming
- Sync vs local storage
- Incremental Loading(? idk what to call it) 

I would take feature requests, but I'm the only user lol. 

## Side Notes

I wanted to name this project WinDex (window indexer) but my lawyers said that wouldn't go over so well with the
window cleaner company (bonus side note: I have no lawyers. 噓つきな人).
